# Automated-Categorizing-Banking-Transactions-AI-Model
It is quite a task for one to manage personal finances; however, this
project uses AI to analyze the past transaction records and predict
future consumption patterns. The MLP time series model allows the
system to predict oneâ€™s future expense using past data. Critical preprocessing includes date parsing, monthly aggregation, feature scaling, and sequence preparation. The model MLP has dropout layers to prevent overfitting and optimize hyperparameters as it captures complex financial relationships. A user-friendly interface allows users to put a month and year to receive predicted debits, credits, and spending categories with actionable advice for better financial management.

Initially, deep learning techniques were very simple, for example,perceptron, working only in terms of linear relations. Multilayer percecepton (MLP) crossed borders and could group more complex patterns by feeding it with more than one layer. Further Work:Improvement of the project could be: External factors: Economic indicators, seasonal trends, or personal events can be included in order to improve the prediction of spending. The advanced model: Application of other models like LSTM or GRU in order to better handle temporal data. Feature Engineering: Introduction of simulated moving averages and anomaly detection for better accuracy. Personalization: Customizing the model to reflect individual usages in spending while increasing user interactivity. Model Explainability: Explainable AI: Helps users in understanding better the predictions while also improving the system continuously. These would improve the system into a more mature system of proactive financial planning, behavioral analysis.
